# NormalFery
## Howdy!

I'm Fery, also known in the internet as "NormalFery" in other places. 
I'm a guy from the ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¨, born here, and hopefully will *not* die here! 

I'm usually seen working with stuff on both [PridePack](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/pridepack) and [PrideGUI](https://github.com/PrideCraft-Studios/PrideGUI) currently, along with [Joy](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/joy), from [PrideCraft Studios!](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios)! 

I don't *really* have any repos for myself, but I do have forks of certain projects I work on! (And some private ones too)

## Where am I at?

You can find me at my (Github Hosted) [Website!](https://normalfery.github.io/index.html), my BlueSky, both in my [Personal](https://bsky.app/profile/normalfery.bsky.social) account, and in Pridecraft's [English](https://bsky.app/profile/pridecraft.gay) and [Spanish](https://bsky.app/profile/es.pridecraft.gay) accounts! 
I also have a barely used, [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI0BUmXQywFnRfHKTvVfIHQ)!

## Do you do anything more aside from PrideGUI and Pridepack?

Yes! (Kind of)

I'm working on [Joy](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/joy) now too, to help with stuff! (Java is hard.) 

~~and according to blurry I'm the brand new **Lead Creative Director** for Pridecraft which... sure???~~
