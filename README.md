# NormalFery
## Hi there!

I'm Fery, also known in the internet as "NormalFery" in other places, finally in github. I'm usually seen working with stuff on both [PridePack](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/pridepack) and [PrideGUI](https://github.com/PrideCraft-Studios/PrideGUI) currently!, from [PrideCraft Studios!](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios)

Although I don't have any repositories for myself, there is stuff I may work on privately.

## Where am I at?

You can find me at my (Github Hosted) [Website!](https://normalfery.github.io/index.html), my BlueSky, both in my [Personal](https://bsky.app/profile/normalfery.bsky.social) account, and in Pridecraft's [English](https://bsky.app/profile/pridecraft.gay) and [Spanish](https://bsky.app/profile/es.pridecraft.gay) accounts! 
I also have a barely used, [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI0BUmXQywFnRfHKTvVfIHQ), an my now dying, [Twitter account!](https://twitter.com/NormalFer_)

## Do you do anything more aside from Pridepack?

Yes! (Kind of)

I'm working on [PrideGUI](https://github.com/PrideCraft-Studios/PrideGUI) currently! It's already done, but "we"'re (I am) working on light mode editions & always fixing up stuff!
